Group 5,

Good work on the presentation. You guys nicely put forth your reasons for developing
a web app to anonymously chat with facebook friends (1st and 2nd degree). I particularily 
liked that you decided to do a live demo. I hope you are able to soon grasp and integrate
the graph api, as it seems to be absolutely essential part for your idea.

Also, another point from the QnA, do try to look into having a global Blacklist/Blockedlist
for users that are reported negatively by many users. Sort of like 'Report' on Facebook.
It could be a nice feature.

Total Score: 99/100
