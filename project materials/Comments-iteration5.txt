Group 5,

You do not have an Iteration plan for this iteration updated on the website.

Also, you have only one single commit since the last iteration and it seems you 
haven't made much progress over the last one. 

It looks like you have tried to provide persistence for the blacklist users using
node-postgres, but you are lacking any documentation about the same. I guess you 
might find this helpful:
https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki/Testing

But, again I still don't see much effort from your end on Testing. You need to start
working on writing test cases ASAP.

Other than that, there was much you could have worked on for this iteration as you
guys mentioned in the Future plans for Iteration 5 previously like polishing the 
interface, etc.

Overall, you guys need to put in a lot more work for the final iteration.

Total Score: 82/100
