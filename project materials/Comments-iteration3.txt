Group 5,

It is encouraging to see that you have been able to gain familiarity
with all of the relevant technologies needed for your project. The
Facebook Gragh API seems to be quite well documented and you should
be able to get a hang of it soon.

Do you plan to continue using both Gravatar and Facebook api? Or did you
decide to use Gravatar only till you are able to comfortably use Facebook.

You do not seem to have much of the test cases set up as of right now. 
Although in your home.html, you do have a simple test of the Graph API 
to check for successful login, you should be looking into unit testing
frameworks. I remember we were discussing about using one such testing 
framework i.e QUnit for JavaScript. Please look into such tools for your 
testing purposes. Using any such framework on the lines of JUnit would
almost be a necessity as we go along with the development.

Your goals on the future iterations look achievable. A suggestion here, 
instead of just saying 'optimize the matching algorithms', it would be nice 
to give a bit more details as to what you mean by this optmization. Does 
it refer to the speed of matching? or optimizing for some quality factor 
based on how compatible the match is, etc.?

Your chat.js is somewhat lacking in comments.  Also, it seems like you have
an OCP violation in the showMessage function of your chat page, for instance.
Is there a reason for this?
