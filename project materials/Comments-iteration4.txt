Group 5,

First of all, good to see you making progress. It is nice that you have started 
integrating Facebook API in your application. But I am not able to use the
Facebook login - it gives error "App Not Setup: The developers of this app have not 
set up this app properly for Facebook Login." Assuming some problem in my heroku set up,
I also tried using it on your sqwrl.herokuapp.com, but it still gives me error.

This is one of the reasons we have been stressing on writing test cases as you go along.
I still do not really see any significant effort from your side reagrding test cases.
Please look into some framework according to your needs.

I noticed the following for email address validation:

function isValid(thatemail) {
		var re = /^(([^<>()[\]\\.,;:\s@\"]+(\.[^<>()[\]\\.,;:\s@\"]+)*)|(\".+\"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/;
		return re.test(thatemail);
    }

It's generally a bad idea to attempt to validate e-mails this way.  There's a good article here: http://girders.org/blog/2013/01/31/dont-rfc-validate-email-addresses/  The RFC itself is here: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822  The regex you have excludes many valid e-mail addresses.  For the most part, validation should just consist of ensuring the string contains an "@".

Total Score: 93/100
