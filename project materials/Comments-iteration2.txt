Group 5,

First of all, I really like your application's clever name. And, also the presentation and HTML document. Here are a few suggestions:

Your UML class diagram is missing certain portions of your application such as your UI.

Also, you have not given any indication about how the UI is going to be built or designed, and how it interacts with Libraries.

Since you mention you do not persist data, then how do you plan to maintain the blacklist? I would assume it could be the Facebook blocklist of a user, but I don't think that is what you are aiming for. It seems you might need some storage database for this.

Your resubmitted activity diagram is better, but still does not use correct syntax.  Activity diagrams are not flowcharts: each opening diamond should be matched by a closing diamond.

In your GUI sketches, the sketch 1 seems insufficient in specifying its role. Also, I think sketch 2 should come before sketch 1, as you might want the user to login before choosing filter options.
